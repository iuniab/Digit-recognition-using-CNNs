The task of this project is to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for handwritten digit recognition using PyTorch. The training dataset consists of 60,000 training digits (0-9) and the test set contains 10,000 samples, respectively. The images in the MNIST dataset consist of 28x28 pixels, and each pixel is represented by a gray scale intensity value. This method achieves over 96% accuracy over all 10 classes of digits.
